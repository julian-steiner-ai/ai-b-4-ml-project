- systolic : Blood pressure
- relaxation : Blood pressure
- fasting blood sugar
- Cholesterol : total
- triglyceride
- HDL : cholesterol type
- LDL : cholesterol type
- hemoglobin

## Use Case

The use case for our trained machine learning model is for health insurance agencies to determine (after a regular check up on them) wether or not a potential costumer has lied about them smoking on their insurance application.
